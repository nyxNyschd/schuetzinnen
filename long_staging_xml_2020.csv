"IntroductionAn RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument from Inter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED). Thus, here we discuss only the offers from PQ and Medor, based on the documents provided.Point-by-pointPQ sells the MicroTime 200 (MT200), an instrument that addresses every point that was raised in the RFI. The MT200 is the only device that can offer all mentioned functions and answer question (a) of the RFI with comply. Other suppliers could only partially fulfill the required specifications. Medor sells the Olympus FV300, a laser scanning microscope (LSM) and they claim to be able to fulfill all requirements but only with an upgrade in collaboration with PQ.Single-molecule sensitivityThe number 1 requirement that the instrument needs to fulfill is single-molecule sensitivity. For single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the best suited system, as it is dedicated to those applications. To achieve highest sensitivity within the MT200 the number of optical elements has been reduced to a minimum. Detection is done free-space for best sensitivity and not via multimode fiber like with LSM (Medor) techniques where higher losses of photons occur. Another adaption in the MT200 for single-molecule sensitivity is a slightly expanded point spread function size, that guarantees the observation single-molecule bursts and optimal gaussian beam shape. This is done via a slight underfilling of the back aperture of the objective. This is in contrast to overfilling the back aperture, as in standard confocal LSMs (Olympus, ZEISS,...), where the main goal is maximal spatial resolution.PQ works closely together with Olympus (FV3000 f.e.), Zeiss (LSM series) and Nikon when it comes to upgrading their confocal microscopes with time resolved fluorescence. However, while fluorescense lifetimes add powerful additional information to LSMs and works nicely for cell biology applications, for single-molecule sensitivity a dedicated system is an absolute must.The MT200 is an accessible, modular system with maximum access and free choice of filters and main dichroics for optimal performance. For LSMs like FV3000, access is very limited and additional dichroics might be very expensive.SoftwareIn terms of user-friendliness: the MT200 has 1 software for both data acquisition and data analysis whereas with Olympus and Zeiss there would at least be 2 different software platforms required.Other specifications from RFI:— calibrated photo diode allowing calculation of laser power at objective (only PQ),— CCD-camera-based monitoring of back-scattered excitation light for focusing onto single-molecule samples as well as easy alignment of the system (only PQ),— possibility of using up to 6 detection channels with single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) (only PQ. PQ offers upgrades in FV3000 to 4 detection channels only),— options of super-resolution microscopy (STED, FLIM-STED, STED-FCS), dual-focus FCS (2fFCS), AFM and optical tweezers, with demonstrated success shown by systems in the field – Only PQ has demonstrated successful implementation of AFM and optical tweezers. PQ can offer STED but Olympus and Zeiss need other companies to provide this. Dual-focus FCS is only provided by PQ.ExperiencePQ have over 20 years of experience with time-resolved confocal microscopy and they provided an extensive list of customers worldwide. They also offer user trainings and scientific workshops regularly.It is unclear at this point what the scientific experience or customer base is for Medor.ConclusionThe MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provi"

"The ‘Duke of Normandy’, a Damen Shoalbuster 2609 tug, was built in Holland in 2005, she is surveyed and certificated under the Jersey Small Commercial Vessel Work Boat Code (Code) which is enacted by Shipping (Safety Codes) (Jersey) Order 2005 as amended. This Jersey Code effectively extends UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) notice MGN 280 (Small Commercial Vessel and Pilot Boat (SCV) Code) to Jersey vessels. MGN 280 outlines the specification and standards that a vessel must meet and be maintained to, to be allowed to operate as a small commercial vessel under the Jersey Registry.Certification issued under this code requires to be renewed every 5 years and coincides with the code requirement for a survey of the hull, shell fittings, external steering and propulsion. In June 2020 the Duke of Normandy’s certification will expire unless the surveys are completed prior to her certification renewal and examination.The Duke of Normandy is required to assist in maintaining the port of St Helier open and safe during the windy winter months. Once the vessels other commitments in the maintenance of the Islands navigation aids she is often released to undertake charter work for external companies during the calmer seasons thus enhancing the department’s commercial income.Hence, further proposed work is being considered to increase the specification of the tug to expand the scope of duties she can perform. As more external commercial charter work is being undertaken during the spring and summer seasons, timing is the critical path for this maintenance to be completed. We would be looking for the vessel to be taken out of service in April 2020, ready for certification in June 2020."

"Social action is about people coming together to help improve the life outcomes of local people, by identifying and solving problems or issues that are important to them. Some kinds of social action happen naturally. But the extent to which social action is joined up, effective and thriving may depend on how much encouragement, support and leadership it has in a local area.There are many examples of excellent social action taking place in communities across Cheshire East. As such, the Council and NHS Commissioners wish to coordinate and stimulate this further, by providing assistance through a ‘Social Action Partnership Service’. This service will provide a range of support to the Voluntary Community Faith and Social Enterprise (VCFSE) Sector to help them to undertake social action. This will enable the sector to develop and flourish locally, particularly through the building of local connections and partnerships between organisations and sectors.The service will be delivered as a long-term partnership with the local authority founded on a series of core values including mutual trust, collaboration and innovation. This relationship will help to guide how the Council works with the VCFSE in the future, as well as its approach to transforming the wider health and social care system.The commissioning of this service affirms the Council’s commitment to VCFSE organisations by recognising the vital role they play in supporting local people around local strengths and needs. This ‘thread’ runs through a number of other Council initiatives such as the social action charter and early help framework.This contract will be for 3 years with the option of 2 extensions of 1 year. The maximum price for this contract will be 150 000 GBP per annum.The service vision is to develop a strong local social impact culture through effective social action, which is underpinned by a thriving voluntary, community, faith and social enterprise sector.The overall aim of the service is to enhance social action in Cheshire East leading to greater and more effective social impact."

These need to be backed up by commercial kitchen facilities and back of house functions. In addition the Residence has formal guest accommodation — for visiting Ministers and VIP's and then it also has separate private accommodation for the ambassador and his/her family. The building should be a showcase for British Design and products, however it should also be easily maintainable in Beijing.

"An award of contract has been made by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council to commission a supported living service for up to three people in a newly refurbished property in the Pontardawe area where the support for this new service will involve delivering a customised package of care support to individuals in line with their assessed needs.The Council believes at this time that the accommodation will become a longer term scheme which will include elements of recovery and progression for people with mental health needs and may be used as a base for recovery and progression for people with mental health needs in the borough. The 3 service users initially identified for the service will need ongoing recovery support to help them to build on their strengths and progress to an agreed level of independence. There are no current plans for the provision of housing related support funded through the Supporting People Programme Grant (SPPG), although it is recognised however that current or subsequent service users may require this support at some future time, so it is felt that Tenderers should be familiar with the delivery of Housing Related Support and also be familiar with progressing people towards greater independence. The Council reserves the right to include housing related support as part of the delivery of the service at any future time.For information — Swansea Bay University Health Board (SBUHB) are joint commissioners to the service as service Users are jointly funded.The Registered Social Landlord (RSL) for the property will be first choice housing and the provider will be required to maintain a management agreement with first choice for the duration of the contract.As this is a new service, there will be no TUPE requirements and the successful tenderer will therefore be required to either recruit new Staff or to redeploy existing staff to the Service to ensure a fully functional service from day one of the contract.The contract is scheduled to commence from 1.4.2020 subject to a suitable property being available for a period of 3 years with the option to extend by a period or periods of up to a further 24 months."
