"IntroductionAn RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument from Inter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED). Thus, here we discuss only the offers from PQ and Medor, based on the documents provided.Point-by-pointPQ sells the MicroTime 200 (MT200), an instrument that addresses every point that was raised in the RFI. The MT200 is the only device that can offer all mentioned functions and answer question (a) of the RFI with comply. Other suppliers could only partially fulfill the required specifications. Medor sells the Olympus FV300, a laser scanning microscope (LSM) and they claim to be able to fulfill all requirements but only with an upgrade in collaboration with PQ.Single-molecule sensitivityThe number 1 requirement that the instrument needs to fulfill is single-molecule sensitivity. For single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the best suited system, as it is dedicated to those applications. To achieve highest sensitivity within the MT200 the number of optical elements has been reduced to a minimum. Detection is done free-space for best sensitivity and not via multimode fiber like with LSM (Medor) techniques where higher losses of photons occur. Another adaption in the MT200 for single-molecule sensitivity is a slightly expanded point spread function size, that guarantees the observation single-molecule bursts and optimal gaussian beam shape. This is done via a slight underfilling of the back aperture of the objective. This is in contrast to overfilling the back aperture, as in standard confocal LSMs (Olympus, ZEISS,...), where the main goal is maximal spatial resolution.PQ works closely together with Olympus (FV3000 f.e.), Zeiss (LSM series) and Nikon when it comes to upgrading their confocal microscopes with time resolved fluorescence. However, while fluorescense lifetimes add powerful additional information to LSMs and works nicely for cell biology applications, for single-molecule sensitivity a dedicated system is an absolute must.The MT200 is an accessible, modular system with maximum access and free choice of filters and main dichroics for optimal performance. For LSMs like FV3000, access is very limited and additional dichroics might be very expensive.SoftwareIn terms of user-friendliness: the MT200 has 1 software for both data acquisition and data analysis whereas with Olympus and Zeiss there would at least be 2 different software platforms required.Other specifications from RFI:— calibrated photo diode allowing calculation of laser power at objective (only PQ),— CCD-camera-based monitoring of back-scattered excitation light for focusing onto single-molecule samples as well as easy alignment of the system (only PQ),— possibility of using up to 6 detection channels with single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) (only PQ. PQ offers upgrades in FV3000 to 4 detection channels only),— options of super-resolution microscopy (STED, FLIM-STED, STED-FCS), dual-focus FCS (2fFCS), AFM and optical tweezers, with demonstrated success shown by systems in the field – Only PQ has demonstrated successful implementation of AFM and optical tweezers. PQ can offer STED but Olympus and Zeiss need other companies to provide this. Dual-focus FCS is only provided by PQ.ExperiencePQ have over 20 years of experience with time-resolved confocal microscopy and they provided an extensive list of customers worldwide. They also offer user trainings and scientific workshops regularly.It is unclear at this point what the scientific experience or customer base is for Medor.ConclusionThe MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provi"

"The ‘Duke of Normandy’, a Damen Shoalbuster 2609 tug, was built in Holland in 2005, she is surveyed and certificated under the Jersey Small Commercial Vessel Work Boat Code (Code) which is enacted by Shipping (Safety Codes) (Jersey) Order 2005 as amended. This Jersey Code effectively extends UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) notice MGN 280 (Small Commercial Vessel and Pilot Boat (SCV) Code) to Jersey vessels. MGN 280 outlines the specification and standards that a vessel must meet and be maintained to, to be allowed to operate as a small commercial vessel under the Jersey Registry.Certification issued under this code requires to be renewed every 5 years and coincides with the code requirement for a survey of the hull, shell fittings, external steering and propulsion. In June 2020 the Duke of Normandy’s certification will expire unless the surveys are completed prior to her certification renewal and examination.The Duke of Normandy is required to assist in maintaining the port of St Helier open and safe during the windy winter months. Once the vessels other commitments in the maintenance of the Islands navigation aids she is often released to undertake charter work for external companies during the calmer seasons thus enhancing the department’s commercial income.Hence, further proposed work is being considered to increase the specification of the tug to expand the scope of duties she can perform. As more external commercial charter work is being undertaken during the spring and summer seasons, timing is the critical path for this maintenance to be completed. We would be looking for the vessel to be taken out of service in April 2020, ready for certification in June 2020."

"Social action is about people coming together to help improve the life outcomes of local people, by identifying and solving problems or issues that are important to them. Some kinds of social action happen naturally. But the extent to which social action is joined up, effective and thriving may depend on how much encouragement, support and leadership it has in a local area.There are many examples of excellent social action taking place in communities across Cheshire East. As such, the Council and NHS Commissioners wish to coordinate and stimulate this further, by providing assistance through a ‘Social Action Partnership Service’. This service will provide a range of support to the Voluntary Community Faith and Social Enterprise (VCFSE) Sector to help them to undertake social action. This will enable the sector to develop and flourish locally, particularly through the building of local connections and partnerships between organisations and sectors.The service will be delivered as a long-term partnership with the local authority founded on a series of core values including mutual trust, collaboration and innovation. This relationship will help to guide how the Council works with the VCFSE in the future, as well as its approach to transforming the wider health and social care system.The commissioning of this service affirms the Council’s commitment to VCFSE organisations by recognising the vital role they play in supporting local people around local strengths and needs. This ‘thread’ runs through a number of other Council initiatives such as the social action charter and early help framework.This contract will be for 3 years with the option of 2 extensions of 1 year. The maximum price for this contract will be 150 000 GBP per annum.The service vision is to develop a strong local social impact culture through effective social action, which is underpinned by a thriving voluntary, community, faith and social enterprise sector.The overall aim of the service is to enhance social action in Cheshire East leading to greater and more effective social impact."
"The FCO are seeking architects with the right combination of exceptional design expertise and a demonstrable collaborative approach to working alongside the FCO's selected delivery team. Experience of previous work for the design and delivery of similar buildings in Beijing, China or the Far East generally may be an advantage. The Circa 1 100 square metre Ambassador's Residence will in effect be a mini hotel. It has entertainment spaces, reception spaces, formal dining rooms and access to the grounds. These need to be backed up by commercial kitchen facilities and back of house functions. In addition the Residence has formal guest accommodation — for visiting Ministers and VIP's and then it also has separate private accommodation for the ambassador and his/her family. The building should be a showcase for British Design and products, however it should also be easily maintainable in Beijing. Thought needs to be given to its function as a representational building but also to respect Chinese sensitivities such as Feng Shui. The FCO do not want to have a building which does not respect those 'Rules'. The building also needs to be seismically resilient."

"An award of contract has been made by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council to commission a supported living service for up to three people in a newly refurbished property in the Pontardawe area where the support for this new service will involve delivering a customised package of care support to individuals in line with their assessed needs.The Council believes at this time that the accommodation will become a longer term scheme which will include elements of recovery and progression for people with mental health needs and may be used as a base for recovery and progression for people with mental health needs in the borough.

"The Healthy Knowsley Service model aims to encourage and support people to access healthy living opportunities, whether they are available independently in the local community or are directly commissioned by Knowsley Council or other responsible authorities, such as Knowsley Clinical Commissioning Group.National and local research indicates that those most affected by health inequalities are likely to have multiple unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Therefore, these behaviours should be supported in an integrated manner to offer a personalised approach. The development and design of the model has been underpinned by the values and principles listed below, which will continue to be central throughout the implementation of the model:— choice— partnership working— cost effective— needs led— targeted— joined up— shared information (with appropriate governance)— aims and outcome focused— high quality— shared goals for providers— diversity leading to new ways of engaging— transparent— seamless transition between services/interventions— social value.Through the ‘Better Together’ way of working the Council aims to support community health development and enable community organisations to become viable and sustainable deliverers of services in their own right. It is envisaged that any contractor delivering the Healthy Knowsley Service will identify ways to involve local community groups in a way that may improve their viability and sustainability."

"The Council is a Waste Disposal Authority (‘WDA’) pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The functions of the Council include managing the disposal of waste pursuant to the Council’s statutory duties and powers as defined in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This is a procurement for the provision of waste treatment/disposal services (as more fully described in the invitation to tender documents) (the ‘Services’) to assist the Council in carrying out its functions as a WDA. The Council has a requirement for residual waste disposal services to bridge a projected shortfall in waste services in the Council’s Administrative area. This procurement is for the award of up to four contracts for the provision of treatment and/or disposal capacity of up to an aggregate of 40 000 tonnes per annum of contract waste arising from the Council’s Administrative area (the ‘Council’s Tonnage Requirement’). This procurement is divided in to lots. Each lot represents a maximum tonnage of 10 000 tonnes of capacity per annum. The Council intends to award up to one contract in respect of each lot in order to fully cater for the Council’s tonnage requirement. Lot 1 is for the provision of treatment and/or disposal facilities for 10 000 tonnes per annum of contract waste. In order for the Council to meet its waste disposal and treatment requirement, tenderers are invited to both(i) submit more than one tender; and(ii) in respect of each tender to make more than one submission (i.e. to state whether a single tender is submitted in respect of one or more lots). In a single tender with multiple submissions all of the submissions will be identical i.e. they will have a single delivery and pricing proposal for multiple lots of 10 000 tonnes per annum. Each tender will be required to specify a single delivery point (to which the Council will deliver contract waste), treatment and/or disposal of contract waste may take place at one or more sites specified by the tenderer. If awarded a contract, the tenderer’s specified delivery point will be the point to which all Waste under that contract will be delivered, and the point at which ownership for and risk of such waste will pass to that contractor. The delivery point must be a site (which may be a transfer station or a disposal facility) owned and controlled by or on behalf of the tenderer. From time to time the contractor may propose a change of delivery point, but acceptance of this change shall be subject to the Council’s discretion. Full details are provided in the procurement documents which are being made available together with this contract notice. Tenderers should note that street sweepings are part of a separate contract and do not form part of this procurement. Tenderers should also note that it is not the intention that Bulky Loads will be delivered to delivery points for disposal or treatment under any contract. The contracts make provision for what should happen if the Council should deliver a Bulky Load. The Council reserves the right to deliver contract waste in any order of priority, or not to deliver at all, to any facility that is awarded a contract. Full details are provided in the procurement documents which are being made available together with this contract notice. Contracts awarded under this procurement process will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tenders from the point of view of the Council and as more fully described in the invitation to tender documents."

"At present the Trust utilises 3 main suppliers for pacemakers (Abbott, Medtronic and Biotronic) yet is also obliged to cater for other manufacturers as a patient’s care and previous procurement dictate. Therefore, there are a number of pacemakers with each manufacturer and individual patient requirements (decision made at time of insertion) which will also have a decisive factor regarding pacemaker to be used. The Trust is obliged to keep the same manufacturer in perpetuity for long term clinical/technical care.Patients with different CIED (Cardiac Implanted Electronic Device) implants are monitored in varied ways pending the manufacturer, implants and patient parameters. CIED’s, refers to pacemakers, loop recorders and internal defibrillators.The Trust monitors CIED in the following ways:Pacemaker clinic:Face to face visits for all types of CIED patients.Pacemaker processors generate a long paper report usually in ‘receipt’ form. Selected parts of this are then manually transcribed into CVIS. The report has to be kept in its entirety by the Trust for 30 years posthumously alongside a 2 page A4 report per visit. This 2 page report is posted to GPs and stored with receipt form in the paper pacemaker notes.Home monitoring:Transmissions from patients homes for a selection of the CIED patient.Patient’s home monitoring device will send a report of an incident should it occur. There are standard manufacturer specific reports sent at set time and additional frequent transmissions due to triggers by the patient’s abnormal heart rhythm. Staff log on to all pacemaker web based applications in order to check these transmissions and potentially book/schedule an earlier face to face for a patient if required. As well as this they interpret, measure and calculate each patient transmissions and subsequently manually attach them to a CVIS report and escalating as appropriate. This report may be sent to cardiologists and GPs as clinically indicated.Overall RequirementsA solution capable of interfacing with all current and future CIED’s as well as integration with current I.T. systems held within the Trust Cardiac centre.In summary the Trust would like to improve the processes below:— manual transcription (with the risk of transcription error),— entirety of reports not being available in electronic format,— initiate electronic CIED records from implant and reduce paper records,— paper and time heavy processes,— multivendor interface consolidation. The Trust currently uses a number of supplier for CIED’s,— digital database for improved technical patient analysis.The Trust believes that the solution is only available by Fysicon UK Ltd will move forward with contractual discussion unless another supplier can provide this service. A full description of the specification is available from the Trust procurement team."

"Sykehusinnkjøp HF, medicines division (Sykehusinnkjøp), is procuring and obtaining tenders for health company financed medicines. Sykehusinnkjøp has been given a mandate to procure the medicine. Sykehusinnkjøp (Norwegian Hospital Procurement) has previously announced and held an open tender contest for parenteral pharmaceutical special preparations ('LIS 200c Parenteral Pharmaceutical Special Preparations’) (contest). The contest included the mentioned medicine, as the tender documentation annex 3 — 'Active Ingredients List' requested tenders for the active ingredient (the medicine or reasonable alternatives).Sykehusinnkjøp therefore believes that there are grounds to make the procurement without a contest. The basis for the grounds are in accordance with the public procurement regulations, Section 13-4 a), c.f., Section 13-3.Tenders were not received in the above-mentioned contest for the active ingredient in question (medicine or reasonable alternatives), and this part of the contest must therefore be marked as unsuccessful.Sykehusinnkjøp has now examined which relevant medicines fulfil the regulatory requirements in Norway. If a medicine has a marketing licence in Norway, you cannot just procure an alternative medicine with a marketing licence in another country in the EU/EEA area. This is in the law on medicines, etc., Sections 8 and 10, sml. regulations on medicines chapter 2. This is further connected to Sykehusinnkjøp as a medicine intermediary having a right to its operations, c.f., the regulations on wholesaler operations with medicines, Section 33.According to www.legemiddelsok.no there are no other companies that the Supplier that have a marketing licence for the medicine in Norway.Sykehusinnkjøp has assessed that no other possible tenderers of the medicine will be able to fulfil the regulatory requirements in Norway (marketing licence in Norway), and be able to deliver so that the contract is fulfilled by the contracting authority's required date, and that there are no reasonable alternatives to the medicine.It is, therefore, objectively impossible to hold an ordinary contest or a contest in accordance with the public procurement regulations, Section 13-3. The scope of the contract is not larger than necessary.Based on this, Sykehusinnkjøp intends to enter into a contract between Helse Vest RHF and the Supplier for the procurement of the medicine.Sykehusinnkjøp requests that those who have objections to this voluntary ex-ante transparency notice submit feedback before the waiting period, which is set to 10 days calculated from the day after the publication of the voluntary ex-ante transparency notice. If no objections are received, a contract will be signed after the waiting period has expired."

"Please note this is not a new contract award notice, this is notification of modification to an existing legally provisioned contract that was awarded on contracts finder under the old regime. Please also note the Contract was awarded to Care UK which has now changed names to Practice Plus Group (PPG).Market modification noticeDue to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, Portsmouth CCG and associate commissioners are unable to progress with original commissioning intentions related to the transformation of community elective and urgent care services.Therefore, in relation to the Treatment Centre contract (Portsmouth), let to the Practice Plus Group (formally Care UK), the CCG intends to extend the contract. This contract was originally awarded until 5 January 2021 with an option to extend to 5 January 2023. The CCG intends to utilise this extension; however, in recognition that the contract is due to expire in the height of winter pressures and over the Christmas period, the CCG intends to modify the contract to extend its duration by an additional 3 months to 31 March 2023. This will negate the need to terminate the existing contract during the winter months and for any provider to mobilise a new contract during this time.In recognition of the changing landscape created by the Covid-19 pandemic the contract extension will incorporate decreases in Dermatology and ENT community service provision, and an expected increase in age-related audiology provision.Commissioners will work with the incumbent provider to explore the introduction of the ‘111 First’ model currently being piloted at the Portsmouth Hospital University Trust Emergency Department, and explore virtual GP support to the urgent treatment centre.Total contract value over 27 months = GBP 34 million (GBP 15 million per annum)."

"Decentralization of Road Maintenance in LiberiaDue to a lack of rehabilitation and maintenance, Liberia's road infrastructure is in a poor state of serviceability. Major parts of the country are largely impassable, especially during the rainy season and more than half of the population is inadequately connected to the road network. The project ‘Capacity Development in the Transport Sector in Liberia’ (implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ) supports the Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Liberia in establishing a road and bridge maintenance system with the setup of a Road Fund for financing and the elaboration of data-based road maintenance plans.According to the Road Fund Act, MPW must develop data-based road maintenance plans, which are approved by an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC) and financed by means of the National Road Fund. The data system used for routine maintenance is ROMAPs, HDM4 is used for periodic maintenance planning of the primary network. Annual road maintenance plans have to be developed by MPW and submitted to the National Road Fund (NRF) every year by early March. The NRF must present the plans to the IMSC to be approved and finalized latest by end of June to start tender procedures immediately. Start of works after awarding is October/November to use dry season between October/November and April/May to implement mechanised maintenance works. Labour based works can continue throughout the year.Procedures between MPW, IMSC, NRF and contractors to collect data, to design, tender, award and supervise maintenance works on roads do exist, but are not consistently applied. The Road Fund requires Responsible Agencies (counties and MPW) to ensure good stewardship of resources provided by the Road Fund through effective tendering and contract management. This requires the preparation of credible work plans and budgets, tender documents and then the subsequent tender, award and supervision of the works. Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for Liberia have been introduced with the support of GIZ. SBD's have been successfully tested in 2019 with small road and bridge maintenance works contracts. Capacity in the MPW and regions is currently inadequate to face these tasks, so capacity must be built so that in time they can operate effectively.Within the program it is foreseen to support the Ministry of Public Works to decentralize road maintenance activities into southeastern counties.

"Sykehusinnkjøp HF, Divisjon legemidler (LIS) is collecting tenders for medicines that are used by the Health Trusts. LIS has previously announced and implemented an open tender competition for parenteral special pharmaceutical preparations (LIS 2001c). The competition includes active ingredients in accordance with the tender documentation, Annex 3 — the active ingredients list.A new need has arisen after the contracts were signed for contracts for the delivery of Esomeprazole for infusion (ATC code A02BC05) as the selected supplier has announced that the delivery of their product cannot be maintained.Due to this, LIS intends to enter into contracts between the regional health trusts (the Contracting Authorities) and Grürenthal Norway AS (the Supplier) as an additional contract to LIS 2001c, i.e., the scope and length of the contract must follow the mentioned procurement (including access to extensions and terminations), without a new competition being held for this ingredient. The health companies that are under the regional health trusts have an option to join the contracts.LIS has explored the market situation and is of the opinion that it is not possible to hold a new competition or that a supplier other than Grünenthal Norway AS can deliver the product in the same contract period and that the situation that has occurred is not the contracting authority’s fault, nor something that the contracting authority could foresee. LIS therefore believes that there are grounds to make the procurement without a competition. Refer to the public procurement regulation § 21-5, cf. § 21-2, cf. § 13-4 letter b No 3 and letter cf. also § 13-3 letter e.LIS requests that any objections to this intention are submitted before the expiry of the waiting period, set at 12 March 2020. If no objections are received, a contract will be signed after the waiting period has expired."
