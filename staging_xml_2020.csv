14,38510000,Microscopes,Single-molecule Confocal Fluorescence Microscope for Uni. Iceland,"An RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument fromInter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED).The MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provides all specifications of the RFI in a single instrument and demonstrates excellent support and experience. Given the prime requirement of single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the strongest instrument on the market.","IntroductionAn RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument from Inter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED). Thus, here we discuss only the offers from PQ and Medor, based on the documents provided.Point-by-pointPQ sells the MicroTime 200 (MT200), an instrument that addresses every point that was raised in the RFI. The MT200 is the only device that can offer all mentioned functions and answer question (a) of the RFI with comply. Other suppliers could only partially fulfill the required specifications. Medor sells the Olympus FV300, a laser scanning microscope (LSM) and they claim to be able to fulfill all requirements but only with an upgrade in collaboration with PQ.Single-molecule sensitivityThe number 1 requirement that the instrument needs to fulfill is single-molecule sensitivity. For single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the best suited system, as it is dedicated to those applications. To achieve highest sensitivity within the MT200 the number of optical elements has been reduced to a minimum. Detection is done free-space for best sensitivity and not via multimode fiber like with LSM (Medor) techniques where higher losses of photons occur. Another adaption in the MT200 for single-molecule sensitivity is a slightly expanded point spread function size, that guarantees the observation single-molecule bursts and optimal gaussian beam shape. This is done via a slight underfilling of the back aperture of the objective. This is in contrast to overfilling the back aperture, as in standard confocal LSMs (Olympus, ZEISS,...), where the main goal is maximal spatial resolution.PQ works closely together with Olympus (FV3000 f.e.), Zeiss (LSM series) and Nikon when it comes to upgrading their confocal microscopes with time resolved fluorescence. However, while fluorescense lifetimes add powerful additional information to LSMs and works nicely for cell biology applications, for single-molecule sensitivity a dedicated system is an absolute must.The MT200 is an accessible, modular system with maximum access and free choice of filters and main dichroics for optimal performance. For LSMs like FV3000, access is very limited and additional dichroics might be very expensive.SoftwareIn terms of user-friendliness: the MT200 has 1 software for both data acquisition and data analysis whereas with Olympus and Zeiss there would at least be 2 different software platforms required.Other specifications from RFI:— calibrated photo diode allowing calculation of laser power at objective (only PQ),— CCD-camera-based monitoring of back-scattered excitation light for focusing onto single-molecule samples as well as easy alignment of the system (only PQ),— possibility of using up to 6 detection channels with single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) (only PQ. PQ offers upgrades in FV3000 to 4 detection channels only),— options of super-resolution microscopy (STED, FLIM-STED, STED-FCS), dual-focus FCS (2fFCS), AFM and optical tweezers, with demonstrated success shown by systems in the field – Only PQ has demonstrated successful implementation of AFM and optical tweezers. PQ can offer STED but Olympus and Zeiss need other companies to provide this. Dual-focus FCS is only provided by PQ.ExperiencePQ have over 20 years of experience with time-resolved confocal microscopy and they provided an extensive list of customers worldwide. They also offer user trainings and scientific workshops regularly.It is unclear at this point what the scientific experience or customer base is for Medor.ConclusionThe MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provi"

As Jisc has evolved since its inception in 1993 employees have TUPE’d in from various other organisations and therefore there exist several legacy contracts and differing terms and conditions of employment within the organisation.As a result of Jisc’s history there are multiple payrolls which run each month, these are separate legal entities.The automation and streamlining of processes is an essential output of this project and we expect a supplier to advise on how to make our processes make best use of a new system to allow the people services team and Jisc to benefit from the efficiencies and accuracies this provides, as well as deliver an enhanced user experience.Integration with our pension provider, USS, is necessary in order to provide accurate and up-to-date pensions information for each eligible employee.The system needs to be able to integrate with other software as a service to enable processes. This requirement is including but not limited to sending emails via Office 365, sending payroll data to our Dynamics 365 finance system, receiving data from our expenses management software SAP Concur.The final solution needs to be a fully integrated HR, payroll and talent management system rather than individual, linked functionality. This is to maintain data integrity by having only 1 single source and to reduce the risk of links between these aspects of the system malfunctioning and to provide a consistent user experience. To further maximise the efficiencies provided by the solution, employees and managers should have access to a self-service portal to be able to access/update key data and trigger workflows as necessaryIn line with Jisc’s IT policy, the proposed solution must adhere to the following data storage and handling principles:— data to be stored securely in the cloud (bidder’s security policy to be evaluated by Jisc before the award of any contract),— data to be stored in the EU to comply with data protection regulations,— suitable disaster recovery and BCM plans must exist (bidder’s plans to be evaluated by Jisc before the award of any contract),— data is to be encrypted at rest,— 2-factor authentication for logins."

This Jersey Code effectively extends UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) notice MGN 280 (Small Commercial Vessel and Pilot Boat (SCV) Code) to Jersey vessels. MGN 280 outlines the specification and standards that a vessel must meet and be maintained to, to be allowed to operate as a small commercial vessel under the Jersey Registry.Certification issued under this code requires to be renewed every 5 years and coincides with the code requirement for a survey of the hull, shell fittings, external steering and propulsion. In June 2020 the Duke of Normandy’s certification will expire unless the surveys are completed prior to her certification renewal and examination.The Duke of Normandy is required to assist in maintaining the port of St Helier open and safe during the windy winter months. Once the vessels other commitments in the maintenance of the Islands navigation aids she is often released to undertake charter work for external companies during the calmer seasons thus enhancing the department’s commercial income.Hence, further proposed work is being considered to increase the specification of the tug to expand the scope of duties she can perform. As more external commercial charter work is being undertaken during the spring and summer seasons, timing is the critical path for this maintenance to be completed. We would be looking for the vessel to be taken out of service in April 2020, ready for certification in June 2020."

Please see Section V) (award of contract) for further details.,"The Council is a Waste Disposal Authority (‘WDA’) pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The functions of the Council include managing the disposal of waste pursuant to the Council’s statutory duties and powers as defined in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This is a procurement for the provision of waste treatment/disposal services (as more fully described in the invitation to tender documents) (the ‘Services’) to assist the Council in carrying out its functions as a WDA. The Council has a requirement for residual waste disposal services to bridge a projected shortfall in waste services in the Council’s Administrative area. This procurement is for the award of up to four contracts for the provision of treatment and/or disposal capacity of up to an aggregate of 40 000 tonnes per annum of contract waste arising from the Council’s Administrative area (the ‘Council’s Tonnage Requirement’). This procurement is divided in to lots. Each lot represents a maximum tonnage of 10 000 tonnes of capacity per annum. The Council intends to award up to one contract in respect of each lot in order to fully cater for the Council’s tonnage requirement. Lot 1 is for the provision of treatment and/or disposal facilities for 10 000 tonnes per annum of contract waste. In order for the Council to meet its waste disposal and treatment requirement, tenderers are invited to both(i) submit more than one tender; and(ii) in respect of each tender to make more than one submission (i.e. to state whether a single tender is submitted in respect of one or more lots). In a single tender with multiple submissions all of the submissions will be identical i.e. they will have a single delivery and pricing proposal for multiple lots of 10 000 tonnes per annum. Each tender will be required to specify a single delivery point (to which the Council will deliver contract waste), treatment and/or disposal of contract waste may take place at one or more sites specified by the tenderer. If awarded a contract, the tenderer’s specified delivery point will be the point to which all Waste under that contract will be delivered, and the point at which ownership for and risk of such waste will pass to that contractor. The delivery point must be a site (which may be a transfer station or a disposal facility) owned and controlled by or on behalf of the tenderer. From time to time the contractor may propose a change of delivery point, but acceptance of this change shall be subject to the Council’s discretion. Full details are provided in the procurement documents which are being made available together with this contract notice. Tenderers should note that street sweepings are part of a separate contract and do not form part of this procurement. Tenderers should also note that it is not the intention that Bulky Loads will be delivered to delivery points for disposal or treatment under any contract. The contracts make provision for what should happen if the Council should deliver a Bulky Load. The Council reserves the right to deliver contract waste in any order of priority, or not to deliver at all, to any facility that is awarded a contract. Full details are provided in the procurement documents which are being made available together with this contract notice. Contracts awarded under this procurement process will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tenders from the point of view of the Council and as more fully described in the invitation to tender documents."

Technical assistance is requested to support MPW to decentralize road maintenance into southeastern counties, including review of regional capacities to manage maintenance works, preparation of a management plan for maintenance supervision, review and monitoring of supervision plans, monitoring of works, management of contractor billing, capacity building, establishing of reporting systems, site diaries and document management systems, on the job learning and information sharing, collection of road network data for planning maintenance, preparation of annual procurement plans etc. The service requested is expected to be started in January 2020 and will continue for 21 months. One office in the focus region must be established, two vehicles will be provided. Estimated contract value is 1 000 000 EUR.","Decentralization of Road Maintenance in LiberiaDue to a lack of rehabilitation and maintenance, Liberia's road infrastructure is in a poor state of serviceability. Major parts of the country are largely impassable, especially during the rainy season and more than half of the population is inadequately connected to the road network. The project ‘Capacity Development in the Transport Sector in Liberia’ (implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ) supports the Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Liberia in establishing a road and bridge maintenance system with the setup of a Road Fund for financing and the elaboration of data-based road maintenance plans.According to the Road Fund Act, MPW must develop data-based road maintenance plans, which are approved by an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC) and financed by means of the National Road Fund. The data system used for routine maintenance is ROMAPs, HDM4 is used for periodic maintenance planning of the primary network. Annual road maintenance plans have to be developed by MPW and submitted to the National Road Fund (NRF) every year by early March. The NRF must present the plans to the IMSC to be approved and finalized latest by end of June to start tender procedures immediately. Start of works after awarding is October/November to use dry season between October/November and April/May to implement mechanised maintenance works. Labour based works can continue throughout the year.Procedures between MPW, IMSC, NRF and contractors to collect data, to design, tender, award and supervise maintenance works on roads do exist, but are not consistently applied. The Road Fund requires Responsible Agencies (counties and MPW) to ensure good stewardship of resources provided by the Road Fund through effective tendering and contract management. This requires the preparation of credible work plans and budgets, tender documents and then the subsequent tender, award and supervision of the works. Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for Liberia have been introduced with the support of GIZ. SBD's have been successfully tested in 2019 with small road and bridge maintenance works contracts. Capacity in the MPW and regions is currently inadequate to face these tasks, so capacity must be built so that in time they can operate effectively.Within the program it is foreseen to support the Ministry of Public Works to decentralize road maintenance activities into southeastern counties. The service is requested for offers for technical assistance to support those activities in southeastern counties including review of regional capacities to manage maintenance works, preparation of a management plan for maintenance supervision, review and monitoring of supervision plans, monitoring of works and their management through regular site visits, management of contractor billing, capacity building, establishing of reporting systems, site diaries and document management systems, on the job learning and information sharing, collection of road network data for planning maintenance, preparation of annual procurement plans, etc.A personnel concept must include two long-term expert positions for a team leader and a field engineer, a 2-month assignment for a short-term expert is requested to identify road maintenance projects in the beginning of the assignment. The service requested is expected to be started in January 2020 and will continue for 21 months. One office in the focus region must be established by the contractor. Two vehicles will be provided by GIZ. The estimated — non-binding — contract value is EUR 1 000 000."

Assess the past, current and future costs and distribution, and include presumptions on cost and distribution roads in the scenarios (ii), together with an assessment of the technology's energy, resource, and carbon reducing potential;(iv) develop a Nordic energy statistics database with aggregated data. Establish a system for saving, updating and issuing past (from 1990 if possible) and future statistics and analyses that can trace progress in the development of energy technology and as regards the 2020 scenarios and carbon roads established in i) and iii);(v) demonstrate Nordic leadership within energy technology, and tackle climate changes at a national, regional, and global level through efficient and strategic communication."

As sensitive devices will be used in these rooms which are disturbed by magnetic fields, the surgery rooms need to be shielded in order to reach 100nTpp @ 50Hz as defined in the Dutch norm NEN1010 and ÖVE/ÖNorm E 8007 and the DIN/ VDE 0100-71.In the area with the highest magnetic field levels magnetic fields up to 31'000nTpp @ 50 Hz are expected on floor level.",Market consultation magnetic field shielding surgery rooms.
753,38000000,"Laboratory, optical and precision equipments (excl. glasses)",QuickShape IR Mid-IR Pulse Shaper System,Aarhus University wants to purchase a QuickShape IR Mid-IR Pulse Shaper. It will be used to investigate molecular coupling and dynamics at interfaces. The devise will be integrated into an existing laser setup to provide high power ultrashort laser pulses in the mid IR spectral region. The QuickShape IR Mid-IR Pulse Shaper is he only device on the market with the ability to control the phase and shape of high power mid IR laser pulses.,"The customer is an associate professor at the Chemistry Department of Aarhus University and head of the surface spectroscopy facility SurfLab. We intend to purchase a pulse shaper system for a planned research project.Reactions, chemical composition and structure at interfaces are usually markedly different from those of the bulk materials. The properties of a material surface determine its performance in a given application. Typical examples include catalysis, nucleation, sensing, wetting, target binding, and biocompatibility. However, relative to bulk materials, it is extremely challenging to obtain information at ultrafast timescales about surface structure, molecular motion and energy transfer. Two-dimensional surface spectroscopy can provide this information and has proven to be a reliable tool to probe ultrafast surface processes. For a 2D experiment it is required to prepare trains of femtosecond laser pulses in the mid-IR region with exquisite control of temporal spacing, relative phase and spectral shape. The pulse must have average powers of several micro Joule, which means the pulse shaper must be optically pumped with 10-100 uJoule of average power.The customer has performed a systematic search for commercially available pulse shapers.

DFID India is responsible for the implementation and administration of the UK Government’s development programmes to India in partnership with the Government of India.Background of programmeThe UK is providing up to GBP 10 million between 2013-2022 under Infrastructure Policy Fund (IPF) Programme. ITCF is part of a wider UK-India partnership on infrastructure, to enable access by India to leading, global expertise in private sector approaches to infrastructure delivery and financing.The ITCF primarily provides support to the infrastructure policy making unit in the DEA, Ministry of Finance (MoF) which is also extended to central line ministries and state governments. This technical assistance is to improve the business environment for investors and developers in delivering infrastructure, especially high poverty impact infrastructure services.The expected focus is on improving the business environment, capability and knowledge within the infrastructure sector. ITCF aims to tackle key bottlenecks in the business environment by strengthening public and private sector capacity to negotiate, structure and manage projects; develop and test new financial products; develop policy-relevant analytical products, including on global and local lessons and best practices; and support dissemination of policy and investor-related information amongst key sector players.The programme focuses on both:(i) national policy and capacity issues that have a nationwide impact and potential for scale e.g. strengthening aspects of the capital markets; and(ii) on sectors and states that have the greatest impact on poverty reduction or interventions that are considered innovative and offer wider lessons. This approach allows for greater impact and flexibility, while being complementary to on-going DFID efforts in the low income states.Output 1: business environment — improved business environment for private sector participation in infrastructure, including a focus on providing international experience and perspectives on regulations and policies, particularly in sectors with limited PPP experience.Output 2: capacities- increased capability to formulate development-oriented infrastructure projects and to address implementation barriers.Output 3: knowledge generation — policy-relevant knowledge (including robust evidence of what works in private sector-supported programmes and approaches in India) generated and disseminated (including in newly established dialogue mechanisms between key public and private sector stakeholders).Achievement of these outputs is expected to lead to increased confidence amongst the private sector and other key stakeholders for investing in and developing infrastructure, including in the poorest parts of India and in high poverty impact infrastructure sub-sectors.ObjectiveThe main objective of the contract is to provide high quality, fast paced technical support to the infrastructure policy unit in the Department for Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance to support proposals from states and line ministries."
