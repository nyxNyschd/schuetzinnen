22,38510000,Microscopes,Single-molecule Confocal Fluorescence Microscope for Uni. Iceland,"An RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument fromInter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED).The MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provides all specifications of the RFI in a single instrument and demonstrates excellent support and experience. Given the prime requirement of single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the strongest instrument on the market.","IntroductionAn RFI was created to give interested suppliers the opportunity to provide information a potential system that UI would purchase. The number 1 criteria was demonstrated single-molecule sensitivity. Three potential suppliers replied: PicoQuant (PQ, Berlin, Germany), Medor (Iceland) and Inter (Iceland). The instrument from Inter, Elyra 7, is not a confocal microscope and therefore not capable of the majority of experiments required (time-domain FLIM, TCSPC, FCS, smFRET and even STED). Thus, here we discuss only the offers from PQ and Medor, based on the documents provided.Point-by-pointPQ sells the MicroTime 200 (MT200), an instrument that addresses every point that was raised in the RFI. The MT200 is the only device that can offer all mentioned functions and answer question (a) of the RFI with comply. Other suppliers could only partially fulfill the required specifications. Medor sells the Olympus FV300, a laser scanning microscope (LSM) and they claim to be able to fulfill all requirements but only with an upgrade in collaboration with PQ.Single-molecule sensitivityThe number 1 requirement that the instrument needs to fulfill is single-molecule sensitivity. For single-molecule sensitivity, the MT200 is the best suited system, as it is dedicated to those applications. To achieve highest sensitivity within the MT200 the number of optical elements has been reduced to a minimum. Detection is done free-space for best sensitivity and not via multimode fiber like with LSM (Medor) techniques where higher losses of photons occur. Another adaption in the MT200 for single-molecule sensitivity is a slightly expanded point spread function size, that guarantees the observation single-molecule bursts and optimal gaussian beam shape. This is done via a slight underfilling of the back aperture of the objective. This is in contrast to overfilling the back aperture, as in standard confocal LSMs (Olympus, ZEISS,...), where the main goal is maximal spatial resolution.PQ works closely together with Olympus (FV3000 f.e.), Zeiss (LSM series) and Nikon when it comes to upgrading their confocal microscopes with time resolved fluorescence. However, while fluorescense lifetimes add powerful additional information to LSMs and works nicely for cell biology applications, for single-molecule sensitivity a dedicated system is an absolute must.The MT200 is an accessible, modular system with maximum access and free choice of filters and main dichroics for optimal performance. For LSMs like FV3000, access is very limited and additional dichroics might be very expensive.SoftwareIn terms of user-friendliness: the MT200 has 1 software for both data acquisition and data analysis whereas with Olympus and Zeiss there would at least be 2 different software platforms required.Other specifications from RFI:— calibrated photo diode allowing calculation of laser power at objective (only PQ),— CCD-camera-based monitoring of back-scattered excitation light for focusing onto single-molecule samples as well as easy alignment of the system (only PQ),— possibility of using up to 6 detection channels with single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) (only PQ. PQ offers upgrades in FV3000 to 4 detection channels only),— options of super-resolution microscopy (STED, FLIM-STED, STED-FCS), dual-focus FCS (2fFCS), AFM and optical tweezers, with demonstrated success shown by systems in the field – Only PQ has demonstrated successful implementation of AFM and optical tweezers. PQ can offer STED but Olympus and Zeiss need other companies to provide this. Dual-focus FCS is only provided by PQ.ExperiencePQ have over 20 years of experience with time-resolved confocal microscopy and they provided an extensive list of customers worldwide. They also offer user trainings and scientific workshops regularly.It is unclear at this point what the scientific experience or customer base is for Medor.ConclusionThe MT200 from PQ is the only instrument that provi"

This system will be procured to run on an initial 3-year contract, with the possibility of an extension for a further 2 years, subject to performance review and then subsequent 1-year extensions up to a maximum total contract length of 10 years.","Jisc wishes to implement 1 system that incorporates the functional areas listed below:— core HR system modules, including (but not limited to):—— employee self-service;—— absence management;—— reporting;—— organisational hierarchies.— payroll and pensions,— leavers,— mobile functionality,— talent management,— performance development,— pre-employment (onboarding).The following functionality is considered out of scope for this system:— recruitment and applicant tracking,— training and learning management,— expenses management.The following pieces are considered in scope of this project:— supplier led construction of a full implementation plan, full system specifications, full integration plan,— compliance with security and data requirements,— data migration,— any integration work, including with our Applicant Tracking System,— UAT,— training for staff,— handover to BAU support systems.Jisc has approximately 750 employees (and plans to grow by merger activity) consisting of permanent and fixed term staff. As Jisc has evolved since its inception in 1993 employees have TUPE’d in from various other organisations and therefore there exist several legacy contracts and differing terms and conditions of employment within the organisation.As a result of Jisc’s history there are multiple payrolls which run each month, these are separate legal entities.The automation and streamlining of processes is an essential output of this project and we expect a supplier to advise on how to make our processes make best use of a new system to allow the people services team and Jisc to benefit from the efficiencies and accuracies this provides, as well as deliver an enhanced user experience.Integration with our pension provider, USS, is necessary in order to provide accurate and up-to-date pensions information for each eligible employee.The system needs to be able to integrate with other software as a service to enable processes. This requirement is including but not limited to sending emails via Office 365, sending payroll data to our Dynamics 365 finance system, receiving data from our expenses management software SAP Concur.The final solution needs to be a fully integrated HR, payroll and talent management system rather than individual, linked functionality. This is to maintain data integrity by having only 1 single source and to reduce the risk of links between these aspects of the system malfunctioning and to provide a consistent user experience. To further maximise the efficiencies provided by the solution, employees and managers should have access to a self-service portal to be able to access/update key data and trigger workflows as necessaryIn line with Jisc’s IT policy, the proposed solution must adhere to the following data storage and handling principles:— data to be stored securely in the cloud (bidder’s security policy to be evaluated by Jisc before the award of any contract),— data to be stored in the EU to comply with data protection regulations,— suitable disaster recovery and BCM plans must exist (bidder’s plans to be evaluated by Jisc before the award of any contract),— data is to be encrypted at rest,— 2-factor authentication for logins."

This Jersey Code effectively extends UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) notice MGN 280 (Small Commercial Vessel and Pilot Boat (SCV) Code) to Jersey vessels. MGN 280 outlines the specification and standards that a vessel must meet and be maintained to, to be allowed to operate as a small commercial vessel under the Jersey Registry.Certification issued under this code requires to be renewed every 5 years and coincides with the code requirement for a survey of the hull, shell fittings, external steering and propulsion. In June 2020 the Duke of Normandy’s certification will expire unless the surveys are completed prior to her certification renewal and examination.The Duke of Normandy is required to assist in maintaining the port of St Helier open and safe during the windy winter months. Once the vessels other commitments in the maintenance of the Islands navigation aids she is often released to undertake charter work for external companies during the calmer seasons thus enhancing the department’s commercial income.Hence, further proposed work is being considered to increase the specification of the tug to expand the scope of duties she can perform. As more external commercial charter work is being undertaken during the spring and summer seasons, timing is the critical path for this maintenance to be completed. We would be looking for the vessel to be taken out of service in April 2020, ready for certification in June 2020."
